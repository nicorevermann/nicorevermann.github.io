## Becoming a Freelancer
### Why

For a long time, I felt like my current job is holding me back. A feeling of deceleration in not only skill development, but also about how my skill set is utilized. In a good working relationship, both parties benefit: they each get something they value more than what they give. While I continue to meet my employer's demands, I no longer feel that my role gives me what I need. So, the only rational step forward was to resign.

### What's the goal

My goal is to rediscover a sense of freedom that I feel I have unlearned over the past few years. To speed up this process, I've decided not to seek permanent employment again. Instead, I want to freelance and iterate quickly toward this goal. I want to be an IT craftsman/artisan/engineer for hire, going with the flow until I have a clearer picture of my destination. Perhaps this journey is the goal itself. Time will tell.

### What now

Establishing myself as a freelancer largely revolves around solving sales. I am confident that I can provide value when someone has an IT problem to solve; I *just* need to sell it.\
I wouldn't sell any physical product without an online presence, so why would I sell myself any other way?

### Building a funnel

**central entry point to my funnel:**
- [personal website](https://nicorevermann.com) with all the necessary information and links; digital business card and main gateway for potential clients

**demonstrating the product:**
- a [blog](https://nicorevermann.github.io/) showcasing stories, ideas and projects
- [github](https://github.com/nicorevermann) same thing, but focused on projects and the raw code

**funneling into the funnel:**
- [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/nico-revermann) sharing stories, ideas and projects with professional network and building a further network
- possible [twitter](https://x.com/nicorevermann) for sharing random shit and building in public
- establishing profiles at popular (at least in Germany) freelance intermediaries and platform like Gulp, Hays, etc.

<br>
That should work.\
Start of a new adventure.
