## Building a Solar Future: A Necessity for Prosperous Society
Societies are facing two major prosperity-threatening problems: Climate change and demographic shift.

## Energy: The Foundation of Prosperity
The story of civilization is a story of energy transformation. Civilizations that mastered transformation of energy sources to human usability prospered and lasted while the ones that couldn't declined.  From the first human to start and control a fire, to using it to work on metals, to the age of steam, to this day, civilization transforms energy, uses it to its benefit and prospers.

Prosperity directly correlates with the amount of energy a single person can utilize to shape their conditions. The more energy a person can use, the higher their wealth. 
In that, prosperity of society is equal to the amount of available and usable energy.

## The Fossil-Fueled Foundations of Modern Society
Modern society arose through the utilization of fossil energy sources, especially oil and natural gas, and is deeply dependent on these sources to work as it does.
Many things that are natural parts of society today, and no sane person can deny that, were only possible because of the cheap availability of oil.

### The Hidden Engine of Everyday Life
Take food: Feeding the population is a deeply on fossil fuel dependent affair. To produce the caloric value necessary to feed a rising number of people, the latest technologies have to be used. From tractors, to irrigation, to monitoring and controlling everything, to fertilizing crops, to shipping the product to the customer—every step utilizes fossil energy sources.

Take Fertilizer: The production of fertilizer requires the production of ammonia.
Ammonia is produced following the Haber Bosch process. The Haber Bosch process takes nitrogen and hydrogen and converts it to ammonia as its product. Nitrogen is taken from the air. Where does the hydrogen come from? 

Because of its cheap availability after World War II, natural gas is being used to produce hydrogen for ammonia production. There are other ways to produce hydrogen, for example through electrolysis using electricity to split water into oxygen and hydrogen, but they currently are far less economically efficient.

That is one example to show, that even the small step of fertilization in the overall process is highly dependent on fossil energy sources. That is only one step of a process of one single industry. Almost every industry has deep-rooted dependencies on fossil fuels like that, even in processes that aren't immediately obvious.

### The Expiration of Fossil Society
Fossil energy sources are finite and, with rising prosperity and population sizes, are getting progressively more finite every day. Not only that: They harm the very sensitive climate we humans and others so desperately need to live on this planet.

As fossil fuels are depleted and excluded, we must increase our use of a non-finite energy source to maintain prosperity. We must exponentially increase our use to grow prosperity for a rising population globally.

## Demographic Changes Accelerate Energy Demand
One of the biggest challenges to already prosperous societies is the change in age distribution. The working-age population is shrinking relative to the number of retirees and dependents, making it harder to sustain current levels of societal wealth.

The only way to keep the current prosperity in a society like that is by enabling fewer people in total to produce the same economic output we have today. The amount of energy a single producing person is able to utilize needs to rise, keeping the total economic output the same. It's a story as old as humans: Fewer people in total need to be enabled to provide the same economic value as today, which equals a rise in productivity per person. With a growing workforce, prosperity rose exponentially in the past. With a shrinking workforce, prosperity at best stagnates.

Productivity per person can only be increased through automation. Automation is transporting hundreds of people with a vehicle that needs only one driver—in the future possible no driver at all. Automation is using robots to do jobs that were formerly performed by humans, so that instead of a hundred people only one person that watches a hundred robots is needed. Automation is using information technology to automate the transformation of information—recently, possibly with greatly advanced capabilities using Large Language Models.

All these paths of automation have one thing in common: They require a rising amount of energy to work. No matter if its robots, transport or information technology with 'artificial intelligence', every technology that enables one human to be more productive than before requires one single person to utilize more energy transforming it into ever more value.

## Solar Power: The Infinite Source of the Future
The only viable way forward to resolve these problems is the expansion and exploitation of a limitless energy source. The sun enabled and enables every form of life on earth. The sun creates the climate we and all the other forms of life need to live. And we can use the sun, through technology as we always have done, to cover all of humanities energy needs.

Solar energy is free energy and the only solution needed to keep or even increase the prosperity of humanity. Cheap electricity is the energy source of the 21st and coming centuries. Electricity **must** be as cheap as economically possible, for the people to use to keep society prosperous.

Every single person's wealth is dependent on the availability of cheap energy. Every sector of every industry is dependent on the availability of cheap energy. Every journey from one place to another, every cooking process in every kitchen, every turning up the heat if it's cold outside, everything is affected by the availability of utilizable energy.

The availability of energy is therefore the first and one of the most important steps in addressing the two biggest challenges in our century: The protection of our climate and the adaption to shifting demographics.

### A Broader Impact: Independence and Empowerment
Solar energy reflects western values. It is free, in being decentralized instead of highly centralized big energy with risks ob being abused authoritarian. It enables energy independence, because the sun is no commodity. Likewise, it's highly democratic, because everyone can have their own solar power plant and has the option of **choosing** to feed energy back into the grid or opt-out of that if they want to. Solar energy scales from the smallest at-home applications to gigawatt plants. The output scales approximately with investment, meaning it is no disadvantage to have many small and decentralized plants. The costs of entry are negligible compared to something like nuclear energy. It is available right here right now and not a distant fantasy like nuclear fusion. In many cases, solar energy can reduce the need for long-distance energy transmission, improving system resilience and reducing complexity.

## The Solar Future
Solar energy is the only sustainable path to a prosperous future, offering limitless power that is both democratic and decentralized.
As societies face the twin challenges of climate change and demographic shifts, the sun provides the key to maintaining and increasing global prosperity.
By embracing solar energy, we unlock the power to fuel automation, protect the planet, and ensure economic resilience for generations to come.\
The future of humanity is as bright as the sun, as long as we choose to harness its potential.
